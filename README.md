# Blackjack Simulator

This project is a Blackjack simulator that I created for CS231 Fall 2018 at Colby College. It has a few java class files that build off one another to create a simulation that can either run a black jack game between the dealer and player 3 times or 1000 times to be able to analyze win percentages in the game of Blackjack.
